<h2><a name="purpose"></a>Purpose of the example</h2>
<p>
    This example demonstrates how to use a .NET UserControl (in particular the
    UserControl for MarvinSketch) that has been derived from a Marvin Java GUI
    component. The current version of Marvin has in place the implementation
    necessary for embedding MarvinSketch in .NET application. If you need more
    support either in terms of functionality or in terms of the covered GUI
    components or both, do not hesitate to drop a post on our <a
    href="http://www.chemaxon.hu/forum/" target="_blank">Technical Support
    Forum</a> in the <em>Structure editing, viewing and file formats</em>
    section.
</p>
<p>
    This example demonstrates how to embed a Marvin Java GUI component into a
    .NET form and how to add .NET implementations to Java event listeners
    (callbacks).
</p>
<br/>

<h2><a name="functions"></a>Functions of the application</h2>
<p>
    The application consists of one WinForm which has the MarvinSketch component
    (MSketchControl) embedded on the left side and a number of .NET controls on
    the right side.
</p>
    <p align="center"><img alt="model" border="0"
    src="images/snapshot.png"></p>

<p>
    The MSketchControl component practically offers the same
    functionality as the corresponding MarvinSketch Java application: it let's
    you visually create and manipulate molecular structures.
</p>
<p>
    On the right of the WinForm, the first three .NET TextBoxes display properties of the
    molecular structure being edited. The property values are updated "on the
    fly", automatically as the structure in the MarvinSektch control changes
    as a result of user interaction.
</p>
<p>
    The second group of .NET components on the right of the WinForm demonstrates
    the use of the calculation plugins. The calculations are performed only
    after the "Calculate" button is pressed.

    Copy the required DLLs in the <code>examples/ChemAxon.NET/GUI/MSketchApp</code>
    directory which will be the starting directory for the sample GUI
    application. The following DLLs are required:
    <ul>
        <li>
        <code>marvin15.8.10.0_JnbProxies_1.1.dll</code> or
        <code>marvin15.8.10.0_JnbProxies_2.0.dll</code> depending on the version of your
        .NET runtime. You can <!-- Marvin download:--> <a
            href="http://www.chemaxon.com/download.php?d=/data/download/marvin">download</a>
        them from our website.
        </li>
    <li>
        <code>JNBShare.dll</code> and <code>JNBSharedMem.dll</code> are both
        part of the standard JNBridge package. The directories
        <code>1.x-targeted</code> and <code>2.0-targeted</code> in the JNBridge
        package contain different versions of both of them targeting different
        versions of the .NET runtime.  Use those located in the directory
        matching the version of your .NET runtime.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>JNBTools.dll</code> in the <code>lib</code> directory of the
                uncompressed Marvin installation package.
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<br>
<li>
    <h3><a name="compile"></a>Compile the source code into executable</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>
        Find the <code>init.bat</code> batch file in the
        <code>examples/ChemAxon.NET</code> directory and modify the value
        of the <code>PROCESSOR_TYPE</code> environment variable to match your
        environment.
    </li>
    <li>
        Open a Command Prompt window and call the
        <code>sdkvars.bat</code> batch file located in the
        <code>Bin</code> directory of your .NET SDK installation to
        set the required environment variables.
    </li>
    <li>
        Change your current working directory in the Command Prompt
        window to the <code>examples/ChemAxon.NET/GUI/MSketchApp</code> directory.
    </li>
    <li>
        Run the <code>build.bat</code> batch file in the
        <code>examples/ChemAxon.NET/GUI/MSketchApp</code> directory.
    </li>
    </ol>
</li>
<br>
<li>
    <h3><a name="jnbconf"></a>Configure the .NET-Java bridge</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>
        If you haven't done yet so, execute the following command after
        unpacking the JNBridge files:
<pre>
registrationTool.exe /n /SE
</pre>
        in order to register JNBridge in the Standard Edition mode. (There is
        one registrationtool.exe in the 1.x-targeted and one in the
        2.0-targeted directory. You have to pick the one corresponding to your
        .NET version.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Review the settings in the
        <code>examples/ChemAxon.NET/GUI/MSketchApp/MSketchApp.exe.config</code> file and change the
        values, where necessary, to match your environment.
        <p/>
        The tag <code>configuration/jnbridge/dotNetToJavaConfig</code> contains
        information the JNBridge needs to know how to channel calls made the the Marvin
        .NET proxies. You have to set the attributes of the
        <code>configuration/jnbridge/dotNetToJavaConfig</code>
        tag as follows:
        <ul>
        <li>
            <code>scheme</code>: leave it <code>sharedmem</code> as is;
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>jvm</code>: should point to the <code>bin\server\jvm.dll</code> file in the JRE directory;
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>jnbcore</code>: should point to <code>jnbcore.jar</code> under the JNBridge installation directory;
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>bcel</code>: should point to <code>bcel-5.1-jnbridge.jar</code> under the JNBridge installation directory;
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>classpath</code>: should include a semicolon-separated list of the
            directory path to the required Java libraries:<br/>

                <li>
                    <code>MarvinBeans.jar</code> in the <code>lib</code> directory of the

                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>aloe.jar</code> in the same directory as <code>MarvinBeans.jar</code>.

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
       Make sure that that jawt.dll (part of the Java runtime) is in your path.
       (An immediate way to do this to put it in the current directory of your
       application.)

<h2><a name="implement"></a>Notes on the implementation</h2>
<p>
The class <code>chemaxon.jnbridge.marvin.example.MSketchControl</code>
encapsulates the behavior of MarvinSketch as a
<code>System.Windows.Forms.UserControl</code>. <code>MSketchControl</code> has
a default a constructor and constructor that accepts a boolean parameter.  When
this parameter is true, the Java menu bar is displayed in the Java GUI
components (this is also the behaviour of the default constructor). When this
parameter is false, the Java menu bar is not displayed (the popup menus
triggered by right mouse click will work though).
</p>

<p>
We recognize that the developer of a .NET GUI application will clearly want to
have a uniform menu system -- and this menu system obviously needs to be a
standard .NET menu system. Currently, the recommended approach for the .NET
developers to implement .NET GUI menus is to implement the menu actions from
scratch. The core functionality of the Java control embedded in MSketchApp is
the graphical representation of the molecular structures (and this is actually
the only functionality relevant for this demo). This core functionality is, in
turn, accessible through the API of the GUI components involved. Consequently,
implementing "from scratch" the action for the Edit/Bonds/Aromatize submenu,
for example, would involve: (1) obtaining the Molecule instance from MolPanel,
(2) calling the "aromatize()" tranformation function on the Molecule instance
and (3) setting the transformed Molecule instance back into MolPanel.
</p>

<p>
In addition to its constructor,
its main public interfaces provide a means to register implementations of the
<code>java.beans.PropertyChangeListener</code> and
<code>java.awt.event.ActionListener</code> interfaces to handle events produced
by MarvinSketch as a result of user interaction. The implementation of the
<code>MSketchControl</code> class in source code form is made available only
for the curious. The typical developer will not need to know the implementation.
</p>
<p>
The <code>chemaxon.jnbridge.marvin.example.MSketch</code> WinForm has two functions:
<ul>
    <li>
    displaying an instance of MSketchControl and
    </li>
    <li>
    handling property change events generated by the MarvinSketch instance.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The PropertyChangeEvent is handled in the method <code>propertyChange</code> of
<code>MSketch</code>.  A change in the <code><b>mol</b></code> property
indicates that the molecular structure displayed in MarvinSketch has been
changed. MSketch uses this event to update the TextBoxes displaying selected
properties of the compound.
