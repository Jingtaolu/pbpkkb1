 <h1>MarvinView JFileChooser Example</h1>

<p> This section demonstrates the possible integrations of Marvin to Swing components
    in a practical example.
</p>
<p> In this example we use Marvin as a custom accessory component of a file chooser
    to provide preview to molecule files. In case the currently selected item in the
    list of the file chooser is a structure file that Marvin can import, the accessory
    component displays a thumbnail sketch of the molecule rendered by Marvin. Otherwise,
    the accessory component is empty.
</p>
<p> The file chooser with this custom accessory component is shown in the image below:</p>

 <p>The following text about creating custom accessory components is quoted from
     the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/components/filechooser.html">Java Tutorials</a>:
</p>
 <hr>
 Any object that inherits from the JComponent class can be an accessory component. The component should have a preferred size that looks good in the file chooser.
 The file chooser fires a property change event when the user selects an item in the list. A program with an accessory component must register to receive these events to update the accessory component whenever the selection changes.
<hr>

<p> The following paragraphs describe the major steps of setting up the accessory component.</p>

<h4> Creating and setting up the renderer</h4>
<p> The MolPrinter class is applied to render the molecules. In case the molecule
    coordinates are not given in the structure file, the 2D coordinates are automatically computed.
</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    private static class MoleculeRenderer extends JComponent {
        private MolPrinter mPrinter = new MolPrinter();

        public void setMolecule(Molecule molecule) {
        // Passing the current molecule to MolPrinter.
        mPrinter.setMol(molecule);
    }

    public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        // It is very important to set the scale factor of MolPrinter,
        // otherwise the molecule will not appear.
        // The scale factor is computed by MolPrinter from
        // the current size.
        mPrinter.setScale(mPrinter.maxScale(getSize()));
        mPrinter.paint(g, new Rectangle(getSize()));
    }
}

</pre>

 <h4>Following file selection changes</h4>
 <p>To update the preview of the molecule in case the user selects a different file, the accessory
component has to react to file selection change events with the help of a property change listener.
     In the example the <code>SimpleJFileChooserAccessory</code> object itself serves as the
     <code>java.beans.PropertyChangeListener</code> for the specific
     <code>JFileChooser.SELECTED_FILE_CHANGED_PROPERTY</code> property of the file chooser.
</p>

 <pre class="sh_java">
     public SimpleJFileChooserAccessory(JFileChooser fileChooser) {
         molImporter = new MolImporter();
         renderer = new MoleculeRenderer();
         ...
             fileChooser.addPropertyChangeListener(
                     JFileChooser.SELECTED_FILE_CHANGED_PROPERTY, this);
     }

     //This method handles file selection change events.
     public void propertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent evt) {
         File selection = (File)(evt.getNewValue());
         if(selection != null) {
             try {
                 //Passes the selected molecule file to the importer,
                 //or the first molecule in case of a multi-molecule file.
                 molImporter.setFileName(selection.getAbsolutePath());
                 //Passes the molecule from the importer to the renderer.
                 setMolecule();
             } catch (IOException exception) {
                 renderer.setMolecule(new Molecule());
             }
         }
     }

     //Passes the molecule from the importer to the renderer.
     private void setMolecule() {
         try {
             renderer.setMolecule(
                     molImporter.nextDoc().getPrimaryMolecule());
             renderer.repaint();
         } catch (IOException exception) {
             renderer.setMolecule(new Molecule());
         }
     }

 </pre>

<h4>Assigning the custom accessory component to the file chooser</h4>
<p>
    The example calls the setAccessory method to establish an instance of the
    <code>SimpleJFileChooserAccessory</code> class, as the chooser's accessory component:
</p>

 <pre class="sh_java">
     SimpleJFileChooserAccessory accessory =
             new SimpleJFileChooserAccessory(fileChooser);
     //Adding the accessory instance to file chooser.
     fileChooser.setAccessory(accessory);

 </pre>
 Sample code: <a href="SimpleJFileChooserAccessory.java.html"><code>SimpleJFileChooserAccessory.java</code></a>

<h4>Advanced preview of multi-molecule files </h4>
<p>Aside from a simple previewer, the accessory component can be set up to offer
the possibility of browsing inside multi-molecule files without actually opening them.</p>

 <p>The following image shows the advanced accessory component:</p>
 <center><img src="open2.png" width="547" height="353"></center><br>

<p>In this advanced example there are two additional buttons inside the custom
    accessory component that enables browsing inside multi-molecule files.</p>

<p>The management of the two buttons are not described in detail, only the parts closely related to Marvin,
    but the <a href="JFileChooserAccessory.java.html">full source code</a> is available.</p>

 <p>MolImporter refers to each individual molecule in a multi-molecule file by its
     index (position in file, starting from 0) and provides a method to position
     to a molecule specified by its index.</p>

 <pre class="sh_java">
     molImporter.seekRecord(position, null);
 </pre>

 <p>The second argument is an optional progress monitor object which is omitted here.</p>
 <p>The custom file chooser accessory shown in this section is already used in several
     ChemAxon applications and proven to be useful.</p>
