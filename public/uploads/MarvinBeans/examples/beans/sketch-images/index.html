<h1>MarvinSketch Image Creation Example</h1>

Let us start with the definition of some terms appearing in this paragraph.
<hr>
The MarvinSketch canvas is referred to as the area where all molecule fragments and graphical
objects such as arrows, text boxes, etc. appear.<br>
The scale factor in MarvinSketch determines the displayed size of a Carbon-Carbon single
bond measured in pixels. The magnification is the value in percents that indicate the actual
zoom ratio of the contents of the canvas.<br>
The default value of the scale factor is 28, and this is equivalent to 100% magnification.
<hr>

<p>This example demonstrates how to create images from the contents of
the MarvinSketch canvas using two different approaches.</p>
<p>The image below shows the sample GUI component of this example. There
are two buttons below the MSketchPane component, <b>Get Sketch Image</b> and
<b>Get Molecule Image</b>, that will demonstrate the difference between the two methods.
 To make it easy, the images that are created will be shown by placing them
    on a <code>javax.swing.JLabel</code> component below the two buttons.</p>

<center><img src="sketch_image.png" width="438" height="710"></center><br>

<p>By pressing the <b>Get Sketch Image</b> button, the image of the canvas using the
actual magnification is generated and set
as the icon image of the label.</p>

<p>The <b>Get Molecule Image</b> button creates a 200 x 200 pixel size image,
automatically computing the appropriate scale factor.
In this example we modify the default behavior with a parameter.    
If this scale factor is greater than 100%, the scale factor is explicitly
set to 100%, so that small molecules will not be overscaled.
Note, that the molecule is automatically centered in the image.</p>

<p>The very brief code samples below are taken
from <a href="SketchImages.java.html"><code>SketchImages.java</code></a>.</p>

<h4>Creating the image of the canvas </h4>

The MSketchPane bean can generate an image from the contents of the canvas if either
a scale factor or an absolute image size (with java.awt.Dimension) is set. In this example we use the actual
<a href="../../../help/developer/sketchman.html#parameters.scale">scale factor</a>
of the canvas itself, thus zooming affects the result of the generated image.

<pre class="sh_java">
    // getting the actual scale factor of the canvas
    double currentScale = sketchPane.<a href="../../../help/developer/beans/api/chemaxon/marvin/beans/MSketchPane.html#getScale()">getScale</a>();
    // getting the image of the canvas with the current scale factor
    Image canvasImage = sketchPane.<a href="../../../help/developer/beans/api/chemaxon/marvin/beans/MSketchPane.html#getImage(double)">getImage</a>(currentScale);
</pre>

<h4>Converting the molecule of the canvas to an image</h4>

<p>The image format along with additional options should be set
as a String. The options are separated from the format identifier with a colon, and from each other
with commas.<br>
More details of specifying image formats are available in the <a href="../../../help/formats/images-doc.html">Image Generation</a> documentation.</p>
<p>With the use of the <code>maxscale</code> parameter the scale factor is not allowed to be grater than that of 100%.</p>
<pre class="sh_java">
    String format = "jpeg:w200,h200,maxscale28";
    byte[] imageData = sketchPane.getMol().toBinFormat(format);
</pre>

As of Marvin 5.2.0 images can be created with transparent background in PNG, SVG, PDF and EMF formats.
To set the transparent background, the <code>transbg</code> parameter should be set along with a
background color containing alpha values in RGBA form.
<pre class="sh_java">
    String format = "png:w200,h200,maxscale28,transbg,#ffffffff";
</pre>

<p>There is an alternative to the image generation method which does not require to set the image
    format explicitely, and retrieves a <code>java.awt.Image</code> object instead of the image data.
    This conversion is more appropriate in case the image is not written to file.</p>
<pre class="sh_java">
    Image image = sketchPane.getMol().toObject("image:w200,h200");
</pre>

<h4>Comparison of the two methods</h4>
<p>The advantages of converting the molecule to an image format are straightforward:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bean creation is not necessary, it can even be used as a command line method.</li>
    <li>Arbitrary image size setting is possible considering memory limits.</li>
</ul>

<p>However there is one disadvantage as well, namely that the various functionalities offered
by the JavaBean component affecting the display are not directly available on the molecule itself.
This means that all display options being different from the default <b>has to be set explicitely</b>
as the parameter of the conversion String.</p>

<p>For example, to convert a molecule to an image where the CHIRAL flags are visible is as follows:</p>

<pre class="sh_java">
    String format = "jpeg:w200,h200,chiral_all";
    byte[] imageData = sketchPane.getMol().toBinFormat(format);
</pre>

The available options are enumerated
as <a href="../../../help/formats/images-doc.html">Export options</a> of the
Image Generation documentation.
